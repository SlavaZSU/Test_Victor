# How to properly upgrade EspoCRM from version 5 to the latest

The most convenient way to upgrade EspoCRM from version ***5*** to the current one is to use [Docker Compose](https://docs.espocrm.com/administration/docker/installation/#install-espocrm-with-docker-compose).

Let's say we want to update EspoCRM *v5.5.6*. 
In addition to the version of EspoCRM, we need to know the name and version of our database (for example, `mysql 5.7.43`) and the current version of php. This information can be found in *Administration > System Requirements*
